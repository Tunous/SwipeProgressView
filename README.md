An interactive view representing generic progress that can be altered by user with swipe gestures.

![read-tracker-example](./art/read-tracker-example.gif)

_The above sample is from my [ReadTracker] application. In this layout, [SwipeProgressView] is a container view which handles swipe gestures, draws progress background and provides listeners for other views to update correspondingly._

# Quick start

1. Define [SwipeProgressView] in layout

```xml
<me.thanel.swipeprogressview.SwipeProgressView
    android:id="@+id/swipeProgressView"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:mirrorForRtl="false"
    android:progress="0"
    android:progressDrawable="?colorControlActivated"
    app:spv_maxProgress="100"
    app:spv_minProgress="0" />
```

2. Access and modify [SwipeProgressView] from code

```kt
val swipeProgressView = findViewById<SwipeProgressView>(R.id.swipeProgressView)
swipeProgressView.maxProgress = 200
swipeProgressView.minProgress = -120
swipeProgressView.progress = 15
swipeProgressView.setOnProgressChangeListener { progress ->
   // Handle progress updates
}
```

For detailed information about what is possible see [API Documentation].
